# Strategy

## Jayden Meyerink
### Rules and Principles
#### Max risk per trade
- [ ] Risk to reward in place
- [ ] 10 trads before blowing account up
    - [ ] $450, for 10 trades before taking a L
- [ ] Max trade per session, then walk away
- [ ] Only trade your setup and nothing else

### IFVG Strategy
- Catches reversal
- [ ] Sweep liqudity
- [ ] Look for an IFVG to your FVG
    - [ ] Stop at the swing high/swing low and then put your stop loss at next liquidity
- [ ] 1m or 5m timeframe
### Entry Signal
- [ ] Clean invesion off of the liquidity sweep, strong displacement through IFVG 
    - Confirmation that Smart Money wanted to grab S/L above the liquidity and then reversing the opposite direction
- [ ] Retracement will also work

### Opening Range Break
- Catch expanding markets
- [ ] First 15-minute candle high and low
- [ ] Drop down to lower time frame
- [ ] Wait for clear displacement through the range
    - Big strong aggresive candle that closes through the range 
        - FVG
- [ ] You can come in when candle close, or retest
- [ ] Stop loss goes at the candle that caused the displacement
    - Don't want to see price come back up to the range
    - 2:1 RR
### Entry Signal
    - You can do in 5, 15, or 30 minute candle
    - [ ] Mark the high and low with 15 min candle
    - [ ] Go to 5 min time frame
    - [ ] Breaks range with strong displacement
    - [ ] S/L on the candle low that caused the displacement
    - [ ] DISPLACEMENT IS A MUST
    - [ ] Some people wait for retest, some don't. Just manage your emotions
