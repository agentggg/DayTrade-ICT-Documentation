The top down ICT approach
Interest rates
Dollar 
Trasuries and notes = 5 years, 10 years, 30 years
stock indicies
crb index
gold and oil


anticipatory stage - 

first stage of analysis. spend more time on here than anything else

seasonal tendencies. check if we are in a bullish or bearish quarter. we need to know where we are at seasonally

Yield SMT = Triad of asset, which is correlated pairs that we trade. don't just trade one, find the traid of the instrument and go for it, so how it trends.

weekly COT = What is COT?

Open intrest & premiums = what is this
market sentiment = where is the market going, news, conversations, etc. if everybody is expecting the same thing, then it prob will go the other way
key s&r levels (support resistance level)


execution stage - 

major market tone = what is this?
risk on risk off = what is this?
buy or sell program = daily, 4 hour windows, 1 hour windows
macro s&r on micro charts = daily, 4 hour windows, 1 hour windows
market structure = gotta know where are PH/PL
market flow = higher highs lower lows
time and price = PSH/PSL if asia high was grabbed, look for asia low to be grabbed
trade entry = 

reactionary -
kill the trade if it fails to move, because its not going no where, if it is wicking
dont rely on one day and one event to make a big win. dont look for a big w, look for small w's. its more of the pattern verss the win
if you are not seeing the strong push that you are expecting, close that trade and get out
