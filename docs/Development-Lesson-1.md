# Module 2
### The ICT Trading Plan
- You are not the only predator in the market shift
    - People are out there that want your money
- Over-confidence is an invitaion of ego
- Never assume that your design plan won't hit a losing streak
- Winning is a victory and loss as a **L**earning lesson
- Journal your results
- Do not leave your plan
- The risk will <u>**always**</u> outweight the reward if you are not controlling risk

### Pack small Play Big
- 2% risk or less is enough
- No trade is perfect, 
    - Consistently follow a trading plan, no matter what's the opportunity. Follow a trading plan
- You can make all the money you need risking 2%
    - Wealth is built in time and not risk exposure

### Don't take the bait
- Use patinece to build the outcome
- Don't focus on home-run profit, focus on the small wins, consistent

| Weekly PIP Amount | Levels |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 25 | Beginning Trader |
| 50 | Intermediate Trader |
| 75 | Expert Trader |

**PIP** = _*Percantage in Points* or *Price intretst Points*_
- PIP's are measures of unit in a market

| Lot Size | PIP | Dollar Amount | Formual
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Standard Lot | 1 | $10 | 30 - 20 * 100
| Mini Lot | 1 | $1 | 30 - 20 * 0.1
| Micro Lot | 1 | $0.10 | 30 - 20 * 0.01

Contracts is just a **multiplier**. It multiplies the pip size.

- So if you get 4 contracts in a standard lot and you go long at 4013 and your T/P is at 4000 that would be 13 pip in a standard lot, but the multiplier brings 52. 
    - _Formula is 13 * 2_

_For majority of all currency (USD/EUR) **exluding JPY**, 1 pip is the 4th decimal number count_
- Example: 
    - USD/JPY enter a long at 151.31 stop loss at 151.52  
        - 52 - 32 = 20 so it is 20 pips


- ### ICT Trading Reccomendation
    - [ ] Start off aiming for 25 pips using a strategy
    - [ ] Then go upwards to 50 pips using a strategy
    - [ ] Then go upwards to 75 pips using a strategy

### Modular Thinking
- Small Consitency 
- Shorter term day trade
- Don't feel like you have to force your monthly or weekly goal
    - your monthly goal could also average out from a yearly perspective
        - Jan: $100
        - Feb: -$300
        - March: $900
            -   In this case, March covers for Feb


### Keep Something - Pay yourself
- Take 1st profit and start removing and/or reducing risk after first cash out profit
    - limiting risk after taking half of your first profit will remove emotional and psychological pressures, because you see the money coming out
    - Taking first profit at a predetermined level will assist in buidling ocnfidence.
    **- pay yourself**


# Module 3
## Market Driving Force
_**Intreste rates**_ is the market driving force.

### Understanding the interest rate market
- The intrest rate controls the market
- Each country has its own interest rate, which control the market

It's **VERY IMPORTANT** to track countries interest rates
- Overnight Lending Rates
    - Sometimes called the policy rate, federal funds rate in the U.S., or Bank Rate in the U.K.
    - When rates are low, money is cheap → more liquidity → markets often trend up (risk-on).
    - When rates are high, money is expensive → less liquidity → slower markets or sharper corrections (risk-off).
        - Fed raises rates → institutional traders rotate money into bonds or cash → equities drop → volatility spikes.
        - 💥 This is why <u>**FOMC announcement**</u> days (and speeches by central bankers) are among the most volatile days for day trading.
    - The **Overnight Lending Rate** is how much a bank charges another bank on a loan to close their day
        - Each commercial bank must hold a minimum amount of capital within their vault or at the FRB in order to avoid penalities.
            - a percentage of its deposits, called the reserve requirement currently 0% in the U.S. since 2020 — but banks still manage internal liquidity
        - When a bank is short for the day, the bank contacts another bank for a loan, and then the loan is charged at an interest rate, which is determined by the FED. The rate is usually a range, and the cost is between the rate
            - As of 10/31/2025 3.75% and 4%
                - So banks can loan other banks money with intrest rate between 3.75% - 4%
        - If the rate is too high for the bank, then a percentile of the rate is passed on to consumers and businesses via mortgages, credit cards, loans and etc

## 📉 Market Behavior Summary

| Condition | Central Bank Tone | Impact on USD | Impact on Stocks | Impact on Gold | Typical Day Trading Behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 🔺 **High / Rising Rates** | **Hawkish** | USD ↑ | Stocks ↓ | Gold ↓ | Shorting rallies; momentum fades |
| 🔻 **Low / Falling Rates** | **Dovish** | USD ↓ | Stocks ↑ | Gold ↑ | Buy-the-dip sentiment; smoother trends |

## Core Principle for Long-Term Analysis
The currency market trends on long-term based on interset rates

If the country sees lowering interst rates, the ccurrency is lower. If the country sees higher intrest rates the currency is higher. 
- When the **USD** value goes up, **GOLD** value goes down. Vice-Versa

## Sasonal Tendencies: 
_disclaimer: ICT trades **British Pound**_

Look for Seasonal Tendecnies:

### Example: 
**Brithsh Pound** tends to make major LOWS in the following months 
- Feb 
- March 
- June 
- September 
- October 
- December 

**Brithsh Pound** also tends to make major HIGHS in the following months 
- April 
- May

**Seasonalitly:** Gives you an idea on when or how to trade because if the previous 10 years shows a specific month to always be bearish, then it is recommended to be cautious on going for a long throughout that time

To find the seasonaility chart do this
`Trading View App > Markets > Search for assest (under the search tree, not the popups. Find the specific one) > Seasonals`

> _Gold is under the metal category_

### COT & Commercial Trend
Look at HTF and analyze what smart money is doing (bullish or bearish), and match that, don't go against the grain. If the daily/weekly is bullish, try to trade towards that trend.

### Trading the News
- **Volatiltiy Injections:** Don't trade the news.
The internet is full of robots that will trigger according to news reaction, your job is to stay away. 
  - _Its gambling, and not calculative,
as you will never know what will happen_

- Look for the releae of the news and then wait for after the news to look for signal to enter. 
  - You can also trade prior to the news, or during the news or post news. 
    - If you have an idea where things are going, then you trade prior to the news

## Technical Analysis

### Key support and resistance levels
- Identify key H/L price levels from the hour chart up to monthly, nothing less than 60 minutes
  - Determine monthly, weekly, previous days, sessions high and ligh
avoid the herd mentalitity. 
    - If everyone is doing it, then its prob not the best idea, because everyone is already doing it.
        - Example: **Intraday Judas Swing**, and then finding an entry in the opposite directions.
            - The **Intraday Judas Swing** trade is a liqudidty grab. It is at the start of the market open and its usually engineered to grab liquadity. it usually does the following
            - **Intraday Judas Swing** hunts liquidity resting above/below the Asian range or previous Session H/L.
            - The **Intraday Judas Swing** also defines the day’s H/L early (the daily dealing range).
            - Institutions take positions opposite of The **Intraday Judas Swing** once liquidity is taken.
            - After that, price delivers in the opposite direction, but only as far as the next liquidity draw
