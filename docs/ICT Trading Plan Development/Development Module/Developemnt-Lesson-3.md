# Top Down ICT Approach

## 

The top down ICT approach
Interest rates
Dollar 
Trasuries and notes = 5 years, 10 years, 30 years
stock indicies
crb index
gold and oil


anticipatory stage - 

first stage of analysis. spend more time on here than anything else

seasonal tendencies. check if we are in a bullish or bearish quarter. we need to know where we are at seasonally

Yield SMT = Triad of asset, which is correlated pairs that we trade. don't just trade one, find the traid of the instrument and go for it, so how it trends.

weekly COT = What is COT?

Open intrest & premiums = what is this
market sentiment = where is the market going, news, conversations, etc. if everybody is expecting the same thing, then it prob will go the other way
key s&r levels (support resistance level)


execution stage - 

major market tone = what is this?
risk on risk off = what is this?
buy or sell program = daily, 4 hour windows, 1 hour windows
macro s&r on micro charts = daily, 4 hour windows, 1 hour windows
market structure = gotta know where are PH/PL
market flow = higher highs lower lows
time and price = PSH/PSL if asia high was grabbed, look for asia low to be grabbed
trade entry = 

reactionary -
kill the trade if it fails to move, because its not going no where, if it is wicking
dont rely on one day and one event to make a big win. dont look for a big w, look for small w's. its more of the pattern verss the win
if you are not seeing the strong push that you are expecting, close that trade and get out. don't sit in questionable trades

if price hits a liq and rejects it, then expect a reversal


Fractal Analysis: it is a pattern that is repeated constiently from a high level view, and when you zoom in, it is also repeated. it is repeated in any angle. Whatever happens in 5 minutes trend is also happeneing at 1 week trend.
This helps you expect where the market can go. You look at it from a HTF and then when you zoom in to a LTF, you look for the fractual.
Don't trade against the fractual. Even within same timeframe, the pattern replicates every couple candle

typically price try to reach a resistance level
we expect price to retrace down, and then go back up to try to hit a higher high and go pass resitance
then if price goes below the 50% of the FVG prior then it is a market structure shift. if price respects the FVG then we can expect another attempt at the key level.
