# Market Profile

## Weekly Profiles
    - Early week sets up the high and low for the week
    - Midweek runs towards the draw-on-liquidity target
    - Late week reverse, or extend after major liquidity is taken
    - Monday:
        - Manipulation usually happens here
        - It is best to mark the high and low of Monday
        - Most likely not the real direction
    - Tuesday:
        - Sweeps Monday's high or low
        - The liquidity grab usually form the true high/low of the week, 50-70% of the time
            - If Tuesday forms the high of the week, expect the week to be bearish
            - If Tuesday forms the low of the week, expect the week to be bullish
                - Tuesday is known - <u>PD Array Setup Day</u>
    - Wednesday:
        - Strongest Directional Day
        - If Tuesday created:
            - The high of the week, Wednesday often sells off strongly
	        - The low of the week, Wednesday often rallies aggressively
    - Thursday – Continuation or Reversal After Liquidity:
        - Continuation
            - If the weekly draw-on-liquidity is not yet achieved, Thursday continues the trend.
        - Counter-trend Move
            - If Wednesday already reached the target, Thursday may:
                - Retrace
                - Reverse
                - Form a secondary setup
                - Create another displacement in opposite direction
    - Friday – Weekly Close Behavior:
        - Are they closing near a discount (bullish) or premium (bearish)?
        - Friday often “confirms” how next week will begin.
